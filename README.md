<h1 align="center" border="none">Damyn Filipuzzi's Portfolio </h1>

## Project Description:
Showcase some of the recent projects I've worked on. As well when taking on this project I 
originally planned on using HTML, Javascript, CSS and hosting it on github pages. However, 
after creating a mockup I decided I wanted to use this as a time to better my skills with a 
more modern front end with React. As well I also decided this would be a good time to better 
familiarize myself with AWS rather than using github pages.

## Usage
1. Download Repository
2. In your terminal enter `npm install`
3. Finally run `npm run dev`

## Tech Stack:
React, AWS, JS, Tailwind, HTML, CSS

## **Todo:**
- [x] Set up AWS S3 Bucket with CloudFront.
- [x] Set up CI/CD Pipeline.
- [x] Recreate/improve upon original portfolio project.
- [ ] (Maybe) Host additional projects using AWS to show live examples of other work.
