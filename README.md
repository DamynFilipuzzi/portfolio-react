# Damyn Filipuzzi Portfolio


## **Todo:**
- [x] Set up AWS S3 Bucket with CloudFront.
- [x] Set up CI/CD Pipeline.
- [ ] Recreate/improve upon original portfolio project.
- [ ] (Maybe) Create a togglable dark and light mode that initially renders the site depending on the system preset.
- [ ] (Maybe) Host additional projects using AWS to show live examples of other work.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
